Contributing
============
We are very open to community contributions, but there are a couple of guidelines you should follow so we can handle this without too much effort.

How to contribute?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The easiest way to contribute is to open an issue and start a discussion. 
Then we can decide if and how a feature or a change could be implemented. 
If you should submit a pull request with code changes, start with a description, only make the minimal changes to start with and provide tests that cover those changes.

General feedback and discussions?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Please start a discussion on the `core repo issue tracker <https://github.com/juan-carlos-diaz/IdentityServer4.UI/issues>`_.

Platform
^^^^^^^^
IdentityServer.UI is built against ASP.NET Core 2 and runs on .NET Framework 4.6.1 (and higher) and .NET Core 2.2 (and higher).

Bugs and feature requests?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Please log a new issue in the appropriate GitHub repo:

* `Core <https://github.com/juan-carlos-diaz/IdentityServer4.UI>`_
* `Samples <https://github.com/juan-carlos-diaz/IdentityServer4.UI.Samples>`_

Contributing code and content
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
You will need to sign a Contributor License Agreement before you can contribute any code or content.
This is an automated process that will start after you opened a pull request.
